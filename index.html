			<h1>What are Plastics?</h1>
			<img id="leo" src="images/Leo-Baekeland.jpg" alt="leo-baekeland">
			<h3 style="margin-bottom: 10px; color: black;">Leo Baekeland</h3>
			<h2>HISTORY</h2>
			<p>
				A little more than 100 years ago in 1907, an invention was made by Leo Baekeland in the city of New
				York, that would change the very character of our world and way of life. He named his creation as
				'plastic,' and hoped that it could be mass produced and used for making appliances affordable for the
				common people. Little did he imagine that his invention would go far and beyond, and in every home,
				office, restaurant or car parking today- you could just glance up and spot a minimum of 5 plastic
				articles in your immediate vicinity.
			</p>
			<p>
				One of the earliest examples was invented by Alexander Parkes in 1855, who named his invention
				Parkesine. We know it today as celluloid.
				Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) was first polymerised between 1838-1872.
				A key breakthrough came in 1907, when Belgian-American chemist Leo Baekeland created Bakelite, the first
				real synthetic, mass-produced plastic.
			</p>
			<h2>How are plastics made?</h2>
			<p>
				Plastics are derived from natural, organic materials such as cellulose, coal, natural gas, salt and, of
				course, crude oil. Crude oil is a complex mixture of thousands of compounds and needs to be processed
				before it can be used. The production of plastics begins with the distillation of crude oil in an oil
				refinery. This separates the heavy crude oil into groups of lighter components, called fractions. Each
				fraction is a mixture of hydrocarbon chains (chemical compounds made up of carbon and hydrogen), which
				differ in terms of the size and structure of their molecules. One of these fractions, naphtha, is the
				crucial compound for the production of plastics.
			</p>
			<p>
				Two main processes are used to produce plastics - polymerisation and polycondensation - and they both
				require specific catalysts. In a polymerisation reactor, monomers such as ethylene and propylene are
				linked together to form long polymer chains. Each polymer has its own properties, structure and size
				depending on the various types of basic monomers used.
			</p>

			<h2>Resin Identification Code</h2>
			<p>
				The ASTM International Resin Identification Coding System, often abbreviated RIC, is a set of symbols
				appearing on plastic products that identify the plastic resin out of which the product is made. It
				was developed in 1988 by the Society of the Plastics Industry (now the Plastics Industry Association) in
				the United States, but since 2008 it has been administered by ASTM International, an international
				standards organization.
			</p>
			<img src="images/RIC.jpg" alt="">
			<p>
				In its original form, the symbols used as part of the RIC consisted of arrows that cycle clockwise to
				form a triangle that encloses a number. The number broadly refers to the type of plastic used in the
				product, by chronological order of when that plastic became recyclable:

				<h3 class="is-item-h3">1. Plastics Roads</h3>
				<p class="is-item-p"><strong> Plastic roads</strong> are made entirely of plastic or of composites of plastic
					with other materials. Plastic roads are different from standard roads in the respect that standard roads are
					made from asphalt concrete, which consists of mineral aggregates and asphalt.</p>
				<p class="is-item-p">Inspired by a trip to India where he saw litter pickers collecting plastic and then melting
					it down to fill potholes, <strong>Toby McCartney </strong> returned to the UK inspired. Firstly, he tried to
					do the same on his own road but not greeted with the best reaction he set out to find a way to utilise
					plastics in road construction in a safe way instead.</p>
				<p class="is-item-p">Plastic roads consist of an asphalt mix with plastic waste incorporated into the asphalt
					mixture. The implementation of plastics in roads also opens a new option for <strong> recycling post consumer
						plastics</strong>.</p>

				<h3 class="is-item-h3">2. Eco-Bricks</h3>
				<p class="is-item-p">
					An empty plastic bottles are filled with clean, dried and single use plastics, stuffed inside to the brink
					without any space in between! This makes them <strong> enormously resistant </strong> and like an eco-brick,
					which can then serve
					as reusable building blocks for a number of purposes like building tables, beds, stages or even walls. In
					South Africa even a school was built from Ecobricks.
				</p>
				<p class="is-item-p">
					<strong> Eco-bricking </strong> has turned into a global movement. Not only does it allow people to visually
					see how much
					single-use plastic they are using every day but it locks away the plastics and prevents them from entering the
					ecosystem.
					These eco-bricks can then be put to us as bricks. Used to build structures from chairs to full houses! They
					are a cheap and strong material to build with and because plastic lasts virtually forever they can withstand
					many years in <strong> extreme weather conditions such as heat or rain</strong>.

				<h3 class="is-item-h3">3. 3D Printing Street Furniture</h3>
				<p class="is-item-p">
					3D printing is a growing technology. It allows anyone (well anyone who owns a 3D printer) to download the
					plans for an item and see it printed in 3D plastic right in front of their eyes.
				</p>
				<p class="is-item-p">
					A group of students at UC Berkley have managed to find a way to use old single use plastic materials, melt
					them back down and then use the to produce useful items, rather than just letting them reach landfill.
				</p>
				<p class="is-item-p">
					This was taken to another level by the ‘New Raw Association’ who used the same process on a large scale to 3D
					print street furniture out of waste plastics. It takes 100kg of plastic waste to create just one of the street
					benches, but when we are talking about finding a solution to this waste stream, the more plastic it takes the
					better.

				<h3 class="is-item-h3">4. Novoloop (BioCellection)</h3>
				<img src="images/novoloop.png" alt="" class="is-item-img">
				<p class="is-item-p">
					Inspired by joining a recycling club back in high school, Miranda Wang set her sights on solving the problem
					of plastic waste. She and co-founder Jeanny Yao set up a company called biocellection which aims to find a way
					of breaking down plastics.

					They started from the view point that although plastics don’t look organic or natural, they are still made
					from carbon atoms. This means that there must be a way to break them back down into organic matter once again
					and return them to the earth or use them in new products.

					The team found that there were certain bacteria that could do this, although it would take too long to make it
					a viable solution. So to speed up the process they took this theory and applied it to a chemical process to
					break down the plastics much faster.

					Once the plastics are broken down, the end product can be utilised in many useful products.
				</p>
				<p class="is-item-p">
					BioCellection is now known as Novoloop. The following paragraph is about Oistre™, an innovative plastic
					alternative.
				</p>
				<p class="is-item-p">
					<strong> Oistre™ </strong>is a performance plastic that fights climate change and plastic pollution. It
					combines everything you
					want in a high-performance material and is <strong> environmentally friendly</strong>.

					Made with up to 50% recycled plastic harvested from our <strong> ATOD™ technology </strong>, and up to
					<strong> 45% lower CO₂e¹ footprint,
						this polyester-based thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU)</strong> is a sustainable option for applications in
					footwear,
					fashion and apparel, consumer electronics, automotive, and additive manufacturing.

				<h3 class="is-item-h3">5. Genetic engineering of natural products </h3>
				<img src="images/ge.jpg" alt="" class="is-item-img">
				<p class="is-item-p">
					Single-use plastics, such as polythene bags and straws, are meant to be thrown out immediately after use. At
					least in cities, they are only given out upon request to discourage its use. But the problem is deep-rooted
					and requires alternatives to cater to this consumption economy.
				</p>
				<p class="is-item-p">
					<strong> Genetic engineering </strong>is helping many natural fibers, such as <strong>hemp, flax and jute
					</strong> to acquire properties that can
					expand their use from being used as fabrics, textiles, and currency to become better substitutes for plastics.
					Innovations with flax include <strong> Flaxstic </strong>-- a combination of flax straw waste, plant-based
					biopolymers and
					recycled materials -- and <strong>‘jute soy’</strong> made from jute fiber cellulose and soy resin protein.
				</p>

			<li id="6">
				<h3 class="is-item-h3">6. Chemical Recycling</h3>
				<img src="images/cr.jpg" alt="" class="is-item-img">
				<p class="is-item-p">
					If the first-best solution to fighting this plastic pandemic is finding natural substitutes, the second step
					involves making plastics biodegradable and to achieve it in a sustainable and economic way at scale.
					Mechanical recycling involves sorting, melting and remoulding plastics into lower-grade plastic products. But
					this process is limited in nature as the performance properties of plastics degrade with every recycle.
				</p>
				<p class="is-item-p">
					Chemical recycling breaks the plastic down at a molecular level, therefore, allowing the plastics to be
					recycled into useful materials. Some plastics, such as polyolefins -- the material in a polythene bag -- are
					burnt at high temperatures using a thermal degradation process called <strong> ‘Pyrolysis’ </strong>to
					typically produce fuels
					and waxes.

				<h3 class="is-item-h3">7. Using nano-cellulose for biodegradation</h3>
				<img src="images/nc.jpg" alt="" class="is-item-img">
				<p class="is-item-p">
					Over 500 billion <strong> polyethylene terephthalate (PET)</strong> bottles are consumed globally every year,
					and much of it
					ends as waste in landfills. <strong></strong> Green Science </strong>, a Japanese research group striving to
					<strong>innovate bioplastic</strong>,
					has produced a bottle made completely out of a biobased composite material called
					<strong>nanocellulose</strong>.
				</p>
				<p class="is-item-p">
					This is derived from natural biomass resources such as trees and plants and is inexpensive, recyclable and
					biodegradable. It also has the potential to be used in several areas, including paper, packaging, coating,
					medical and pharmaceutical applications. Transparent nanocellulose paper can <strong>revolutionise the
						electronics
						industry</strong> since its cost-efficient, light-weight, biodegradable, recyclable and possesses desired
					optical
					properties.

				<img src="images/bbbp.jpg" alt="" class="is-item-img">
				<p class="is-item-p">
					<strong>Polylactide (PLA) </strong> is a biodegradable polymer produced from <strong>lactic acid</strong>
					derived from sugar beets, sugar cane and corn. It’s commonly used in packaging industries, textiles,
					electronics, 3D printing and biomedical applications, thanks to its durability and low toxicity.
				</p>
				<p class="is-item-p">
					A company based in the Netherlands has successfully made PLA bioplastic resins from second generation
					feedstocks to relieve pressure from food crops. However, their production costs are high, ranging from $2.6 to
					$5.5 per kilogram, and thus requires government support during its infancy.
